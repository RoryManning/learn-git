       Navbar
       This stuff refer to the styles provided by Bootstrap
       to determine how all this should look. While some
       see it as "cheating" in a way, it's a good place to
       start out and lets you get a lot on a page really
       quickly. You can always go back and re-write things
       yourself. The Harbinger News site is built on top of
       Bootstrap, but it's been modified a bit, and we avoid
       using a lot of the built-in functionality that it
       provides so that we can build it ourselves.

That means you made your own copy of it, where you can make your own changes and upgrades without messing with the officially copy.  Someday, you might want to make changes to the official copy, and that's great! Welcome to open source software. However, we're not up to that just yet, so lets take things</p>

        <p>one step at a time. Once you had your own version of the site saved to your Github account, you <code>clone</code>ed it onto your computer. There is another action, <code>pull</code>, that is very similar, which gets new changes to the remote version of your project.</p>
