       This stuff refer to the styles provided by Bootstrap
       to determine how all this should look. While some
       see it as "cheating" in a way, it's a good place to
       start out and lets you get a lot on a page really
       quickly. You can always go back and re-write things
       yourself. The Harbinger News site is built on top of
       Bootstrap, but it's been modified a bit, and we avoid
       using a lot of the built-in functionality that it
       provides so that we can build it ourselves.
